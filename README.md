# Amazon-Web-Scrapper

## Introduction:


If you are scraping the data for data analysis or machine learning you are creating a dataset of your own ! Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ . If you love this world of Data science and analysis youâ€™ll come across a moment where youâ€™ll need to create a dataset of your own and web scraping is your best tool for obtaining textual data. All the websites would keep updating so the web structure might change resulting that the code might not work but the effectiveness of the strategies will still remain intact.

One of the first tasks that I was given in my job as a Data Scientist involved Web Scraping. 
This was a completely alien concept to me at the time, gathering data from websites using code, but is one of the most logical and easily accessible sources of data. After a few attempts, web scraping has become second nature to me and one of the many skills that I use almost daily.

Instead of looking at the job site every day, you can use Python to help automate your job search's repetitive parts.
Automated web scraping can be a solution to speed up the data collection process. You write your code once, and it will get the information you want many times and from many pages.
